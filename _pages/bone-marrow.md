Thanks to the University of Grenoble-Alpes we were able to create and buy these tables and roll-ups!

The association Pep's (student project for solidarity), the JCE (Young Economic Chamber), FME (France Moelle Espoir) and the 'Blood Donors Association of Apprieu and Isère' have been amazing partners.

We were able to promote Bone Marrow donation in Grenoble, especially among students whose age is between 18-35 years old, which is the age for donor registration in France.

The French Blood Establishment (EFS) in collaboration with the Biomedicine Agency in France allowed us to act on blood collection centers/drives.

We invite everyone to get closer to these and other associations!

You can also make the world a better place by being a volunteer, there are many simple ways to help: blood donation, hair donation, awareness campaigns, etc.

Bone Marrow donation saves many lives, but often we lack donors worldwide!

It is yet not very well known, but ou will be surprised - it is a very simple act, fast and secure, so what are you waiting for?
