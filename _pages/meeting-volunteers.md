# Cologne/Germany 2021

One of our members was hosted in Cologne/Germany by several Rotary and Rotaract clubs!

One of the projects she discovered there is the "running dinner" where some people are chosen to cook an appetizer, a dish, and/or a dessert. A small group will eat the appetizer at one host's house and the main course at another. We get to know each other and move around the city to eat the entire meal!
